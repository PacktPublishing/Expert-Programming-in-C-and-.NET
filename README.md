# Expert Programming in C# and .NET [Video]
This is the code repository for [Expert Programming in C# and .NET [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/17-hour-c-course-intro-sql-and-c-70-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788838832), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
The primary motivation of the video is to understand what happens at a low-level in .NET to help developers write more efficient, and powerful code. By understand what happens when the CLR runs their code, or how the Roslyn compiler works, we can use that knowledge to write our C# code against.We will start with understanding the CLR, CIL and JIT compilation to help frame the rest of the video. Well then move in to advanced C# programming delegates, generics, lambdas, multithreaded programming, changes in C# 6 and all written to C# 6 specification. The second part will look at the things in the .NET framework LINQ, ADO.NET, working with databases (replacing sql server with nosql?) We should also look at .NET Core and cross-platform deployment.As were a video we should also try to make this more visual. We can spend time going through Github code hosting (a new thing for .NET devs), perhaps a quick visual tour of Visual Studio 2015.

## Instructions and Navigation
### Assumed Knowledge
To fully benefit from the coverage included in this course, you will need:<br/>
Will be existing C# developers who have a few years experience in .NET programming. They will know the basics of the syntax, and how to create web forms or MVC applications. They will know their way around Visual Studio, but we should assume no knowledge of new features introduced in 2015. Likewise we should not assume any knowledge of C# 6.0 or .NET 4.6.
### Technical Requirements
This course has the following software requirements:<br/>
OS: Windows 7 SP1 32/64 bit
Processor: 1.8 GHz processor or equivalent
